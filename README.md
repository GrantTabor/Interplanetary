## What is Interplanetary?

Interplanetary is a web application game I created in 2 weeks while studying at DevMountain. The goal of the game is to build up resources on your planet, allowing you to create new buildings which increases the number of resources you get. Eventually you can send out armies as well to take resources from other player's planets.

## Technology Used

Interplanetary was made using Javascript, React, Redux, Axios, NodeJS, Massive, and PostgreSQL. It was hosted using DigitalOcean and the domain was set up with Nginx. 

## RoadMap

When I have some free time I intend to first overhaul the visual presentation of the website, as well as make the experience more user-friendly. Longer term goals would be having multiple planets as well as more interaction with other players.
